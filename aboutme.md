Hi, I'm <strong>Yu-Chen Lin</strong>. A software engineer experienced in building reliable and flexible virtualization infrastructure solutions.

<h1>Experiences</h1>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
Working as a Software Engineer in <strong>Synology</strong>. We are building reliable and flexible virtualization infrastructure solutions on DiskStation Manager (DSM, An operating system that Synology developed). 2016 ~ Now
</p>

### Main contributions:

* Independent designed and implemented a license system for Synology Virtual Machine Manager.
* Cooperated with Active backup team to provide the ability of instant restore to Synology Virtual Machine Manager in Active Backup for Business.
* Experienced in the design and implementation of Virtual Machine and Virtual Machine Cluster.
* Integrated Virtual DSM into Synology Demo Site.
* Designed and implemented Virtual Machine Manager public API.

### Highlight:

* Improved the performance of importing/exporting VM by modifying QEMU. We save 48% time in importing and 38% time in exporting. It also reduces the extra space requirement.
* Improved the performance of company's internal automated testing framework about 9% without modifying CI testing code by letting it be able to run TestSuite parallelly.
* It has been more than a year since the Synology Demo Site was integrated into the Virtual DSM independently, and it has been operating stably without any problems.

In early 2016, I was an intern on <strong>Potentia</strong>. We built a simple chat bot by using Hubot. I’m responsible for surveying and constructing a Hubot environment which can be simply deployed.

<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
Enjoy joining <strong>open source community</strong> to help others. In the past several years I've contributed to many open source projects.
</p>

### QEMU <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star qemu/qemu on GitHub">Star</a>

<p class="about-contribution-text">
QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
</p>

<p class="about-contribution-text">
In emulation area, I found QEMU would use an uninitialized variable which will cause core-dump in some special settings when using vhost-scsi-pci. In addition, I fixed an unexpected behavior on e1000 which will cause Windows VM hangs on booting sometimes.

On the other hand, I fixed several bugs in virtual disk formats. In virtual disk format vmdk, I found there are some problems about creating vmdk in corner case. It affects all QEMU based hypervisor in the world to produce a correct OVA for deploying virtual machine. I also fixed the wrong reading behavior on dmg format, QEMU can correctly read apple disk image now.

Additionally, I repaired a compatible issue between noVNC and qemu in websocket.

### edk2/OvmfPkg <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2" data-show-count="true" aria-label="Star tianocore/edk2 on GitHub">Star</a>

<p class="about-contribution-text">
OVMF is an EDK II based project to enable UEFI support for Virtual Machines. OVMF contains sample UEFI firmware for QEMU and KVM.
</p>

<p class="about-contribution-text">
I rewrote the VMWare SVGA driver in OVMF, all virtual machines using OVMF with -device vmware-svga in QEMU in the world will use it.
